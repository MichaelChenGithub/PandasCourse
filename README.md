# PandasCourse
I held the Soochow University Data Science 101 Workshop and these are some useful Pandas skills taught in my course.
I demonstrated these skills with "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset.
these skills include: 
  1. import & display dataframe
  2. select & display column
  3. process dataframe (Mainly focused on this part)
  4. merge dataframe

If you are already familiar with Pandas, view "pandas_introduction.py" to find some tools.

If you are a beginner with Pandas, learn in "pandas_introduction_detail_cn.ipynb".You can also refer to the article I wrote on Medium. Here is the link:
